<b>CodeAcademy JavaScript Project: Kelvin Weather</b>
<p>(From the course: Learn JavaScript)</p>

<p>Description: <br>
Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction. Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there's a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin. With our knowledge of JavaScript, let's convert Kelvin to Celsius, Fahrenheit and Newton.

<p>Changelog:</p>
<p><u>v1.0</u><br>
I was attempting the Kelvin Weather JavaScript project on CodeAcademy and thought, "Mr Kelvin deserves better, let's give him a webpage too while I'm at it!". <br>
So here it is, a simple front-end edition.</p>

<p><u>v2.0</u> 👈👀 <br>
This is a revamp of the previous webpage as Mr Kelvin has requested for something more sophisticated to match his worldly status.<br>
Changes: <br>
• Webpage design overhaul <br>
• Added a round range slider (number value is linked to input field)
