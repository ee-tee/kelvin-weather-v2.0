# kelvin-weather-v2.0
<b>CodeAcademy JavaScript Project: Kelvin Weather</b>
<p>(From the course: Learn JavaScript)</p>

<p>Description: <br>
Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction. Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there's a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin. With our knowledge of JavaScript, let's convert Kelvin to Celsius, Fahrenheit and Newton.

<p>I was attempting the Kelvin Weather JavaScript project on CodeAcademy and thought, "Mr Kelvin deserves better, let's give him a webpage too while I'm at it!". <br>
So here it is, a simple front-end edition.</p>
<p>v2.0 Changes:<br>
• Added a round range slider (number value is linked to input field) <br>
• Webpage design overhaul
